## Welcome to Execute Big v2.

Execute Big v2 is our new design "flavor". It encompasses everything that Execute Big wants to be: **bold, minimal, clean, and clear**. We want to spend most of our time on improving our programs and creating impact, so our branding is also built with simplicity in mind.

## Colors

We have a simple set of colors: **Celtic Blue (#266DD3)** for official settings, **Burnt Sienna (#DD6E42)** highlights, and **Raisin Black (#2F2F41)** for high-contrast reading. A small subgrouping of colors may also be used here and there.

## Typography

We rounded our heading typography to make us look more casual. Whenever possible, all headings and typeset logo should be in **Nunito Black (900)**. Larger blocks of text should be presented with **Inter**, with weights no lighter than Regular (400).

Both font families are available on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?sidebar.open=true&selection.family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700|Nunito:wght@900&query=nunito).

## Logos

Our logos are really nothing special... Just type out "Execute Big" with Nunito Black. Formally, both first letters should be capitalized, and there should always be a space in between. It is not recommended that these typeset logos are used in parallel with our mascot pig icon.

## Icons

Our icons are heavily inspired by [Hack Club Icons](https://icons.hackclub.com/) by the incredible [@lachlanjc](https://github.com/lachlanjc). Steak, our mascot pig is designed by our friend [Matthew Kwong](https://www.matthewkwong.com/). Other icons are adapted from [iconmonstr](https://iconmonstr.com/) to fit our needs. We also rounded quite a few of them to match our branding.
