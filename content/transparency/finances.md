Our banking infrastructure is provided by [Mercury](https://mercury.com/), a bank built for startups. 

This page is currently in-construction, as we're currently migrating from our old finance provider to a new bank account at Mercury and writing
Goblin, a small router to forward our financial information while masking sensitive data.

Check back soon!

You can see our progress through our GitHub repository.
