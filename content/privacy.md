Execute Big is a non-profit organization that strongly believes your right to privacy, especially given we work with students on a regular basis. We only ask for your information when we actually need it, and we are very careful when handling data.

We hope this privacy disclosure can give you some clarity with how we handle your personal information.

## Third-Parties

### Data Processors

The only third parties that we share data with are trusted, and we only share what's required:

- **Stripe**, for third-party payment processing. We use industry-standard methods when handling your transaction information, and we do not store or collect your payment details.
- **Airtable**, for storing our operations data (ex. when you apply to our programs, or become a supporter).
- **Substack**, to send emails and newsletters to people who have consented to be on our mailing list. We only share your name and email address with them, and we only share that information when you have consented for that information to be shared (ex. when you sign up for our newsletter, or become a supporter).

### Program-Specific Providers

When participating in our events and programs, you may also be asked to use the following platforms and services to register yourself or communicate with us:

- **Google Forms**
- **Zoom**
- **OpenPhone**
- **Notion**

Additionally, if we are shipping you physical material, your information (name, address, and shipment details) will be shared with **USPS**.

### Hosting

We host our software systems in the cloud via the following infrastructure providers:

- **Cloudflare**
- **Netlify**
- **Vercel**
- **DigitalOcean**

## Tracking & Data Collection

To get information about the behavior of our visitors, we use
[Ackee](https://ackee.electerious.com). Our instance of Ackee is deployed and shown as **`dwarf.executebig.org`** or **`dwarf.elf.executebig.org`**,
and all information collected by Ackee is stored on our own servers.

This analytics software gives us insight about our visitors only in general, but not
about individuals per say, as it does not track visitors and does not store any
personal identifiable information. For example, all information will be hashed together with a salt
that changes daily, and daily salt is never stored anywhere, so we can never trace our analytics data
back to a specific user. Go to their [documentation](https://docs.ackee.electerious.com/#/docs/Anonymization)
to find out what Ackee collects.

**Ackee does not use cookies to collect analytics data.**

## Questions & Data Controls

You may request a copy of your data or ask us questions about this privacy disclosure by [contacting us](/contact) through 
emailing, calling, or writing to us. 

**Execute Big will never sell your personal information to third parties.**
