A scholarship awarded to passionate high school hackers in need, giving them the opportunity to attend the best high school hackathons.

## Here's the story.

In summer 2018, we organized Hack Chicago, the Midwest's largest high school hackathon to-date.

We're lucky. Since then, we've had the opportunity to experience dozens of fascinating student-run events like Hack Cincinnati, HackPenn and Windy City Hacks. But not everyone is that lucky, and not every high school hackathon can afford to provide travel aid.

We're here to help. Fill out an application, tell us your story, and we'll cover your travel expenses to get you to the best high school hackathons in the nation.

## By students, for students.

Travel Grant is funded by a number of student-led high school hackathons with their excess sponsorship after the event.
Want to join us on our mission to support more students around the country? Let's get in touch.

## How does it work?

There are only 3 steps to Travel Grant. You're only moments away from an amazing hackathon experience!

### STEP 1: RECORD

Submit a short video of yourself, and convince us that it's worth sending you on a trip to an amazing event! Take your time — applications are approved on a rolling basis. In your video, tell us who you are, where you're from, and what makes you unique. Let's be real here— this is not your college application, so we want you to be as casual as possible.

### STEP 2: HACK

Once you're approved, you can then book your travel, and attend the event of your choice! Hack away, make new friends, and be sure to take lots of pictures.

### STEP 3: SHARE

Share your event experience with us and your event organizers in the form of a blog or a video, so we can provide this experience to even more students!
